# given int list A, length N <= 1e5, where A[i] <= 1e5
# you must pick some of the elements. your score is the sum of the elements u pick. If you pick an element with value x, you may not pick any other elements with value x-1 or x+1 (but u can pick multiple ones with x)
# What's the max score u can get?
# followup: what if A[i] <= 1e18

#dp[i] is if the biggest value you choose is i
