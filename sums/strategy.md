In general, sum problems can be categorized into two categories: 
1) there is any array and you add some numbers to get to (or close to) a target
2) you need to return indices of numbers that sum up to a (or close to) a target value. Note that when the problem is looking for a indices, sorting the array is probably NOT a good idea.
