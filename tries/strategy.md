### tries

type of tree data structure used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large data set of strings

each node in the trie could correspond to a word or a prefix, with the path between nodes representing connections between the prefixes.w

tries are used for word searching, auto completion, (prefix querying stuff)

Tries enable faster searches, occupy less space, especially when the set contains large number of short strings, thus used in spell checking, hyphenation applications and longest prefix match algorithms.
