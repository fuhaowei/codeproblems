### QuickSelect Algorithm: Overview

The QuickSelect algorithm is an in-place, unstable algorithm that finds the \(k^{th}\) smallest element in an unordered list. It's based on the same principles as the QuickSort algorithm, but it's optimized to find a specific element by index rather than sorting the entire array. The primary advantage of QuickSelect over other selection algorithms, like sorting first and then selecting the \(k^{th}\) element, is that it has an average time complexity of \(O(n)\).

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Select a 'pivot' element** from the array and partition the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

2. **Reorder the array** so that elements less than the pivot come before, and elements greater than the pivot come after it. Place the pivot element in its correct position.

3. **Compare the pivot's index with \(k\)**:
    - If they are equal, return the pivot element.
    - If \(k\) is less than the pivot's index, repeat the process with the "left" sub-array.
    - If \(k\) is greater than the pivot's index, repeat the process with the "right" sub-array.

### Code Implementation in Python:

Here is a Python implementation of the QuickSelect algorithm:

```python
import random

def quickselect(arr, k):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return arr[0]
    
    # Randomly pick a pivot element
    pivot = random.choice(arr)
    
    # Partitioning the array
    lows = [el for el in arr if el < pivot]
    highs = [el for el in arr if el > pivot]
    pivots = [el for el in arr if el == pivot]
    
    if k < len(lows):
        return quickselect(lows, k)
    elif k < len(lows) + len(pivots):
        return pivots[0]
    else:
        return quickselect(highs, k - len(lows) - len(pivots))

# Testing the function
arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
k = 4
print("The {}th smallest element is {}".format(k, quickselect(arr, k - 1)))
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
    - Average: \(O(n)\)
    - Worst-case: \(O(n^2)\)
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

### Detailed Explanations

1. **Pivot Selection**: Random selection of the pivot element is crucial to achieve the average time complexity of \(O(n)\). This randomization ensures that the algorithm does not consistently hit the worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Partitioning**: The partitioning steps are what make QuickSelect an in-place algorithm, as we can partition the input array without needing additional storage.

3. **Recursion**: The algorithm uses recursion to apply the same logic to the 'left' or 'right' sub-arrays, which is similar to QuickSort but optimized for finding a single element.

By understanding each of these components, you can gain a deep understanding of how QuickSelect works and why it is an efficient algorithm for the \(k^{th}\) smallest element problem.

### QuickSort Algorithm: Overview

QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that is based on the concept of partitioning an array. It is an in-place, unstable sort that has a fast average-case time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Choose a Pivot**: Pick an element from the array to serve as the "pivot."
2. **Partition**: Divide the remaining elements into two sub-arrays – one containing elements smaller than or equal to the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot.
3. **Conquer (Recursively Sort)**: Recursively apply QuickSort on the two sub-arrays.
4. **Combine**: Since the algorithm is in-place, combining is trivial. The array becomes sorted as the algorithm progresses.

### Code Implementation in Python:

Here is a Python code snippet illustrating QuickSort:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

# Test the function
arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
print("Sorted array:", quicksort(arr))
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Best-case: \(O(n \log n)\)
  - Average-case: \(O(n \log n)\)
  - Worst-case: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the recursive stack

### Detailed Explanations:

1. **Pivot Selection**: The choice of pivot can significantly affect performance. Methods include selecting the first element, last element, median, or a random element. Poor pivot choice can lead to a worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Partitioning**: This is the crux of the algorithm. An in-place partitioning can be done to reduce space complexity. The Hoare and Lomuto schemes are popular methods for this.

3. **Recursive Sorting**: After partitioning, the same sorting logic is recursively applied to the smaller and greater partitions until base cases are met (arrays of size 0 or 1).

4. **Optimizations**:
    - **Tail Recursion**: Optimizing the recursion to be tail-recursive can save stack space.
    - **Insertion Sort Hybrid**: For small arrays, insertion sort can be faster. Many optimized versions switch to insertion sort when partitions become sufficiently small.

5. **Deterministic vs. Randomized**: QuickSort can be either deterministic (always picks a specific item as the pivot, e.g., first, last, median) or randomized (picks a random element as the pivot).

6. **In-Place Sorting**: The algorithm can be implemented to sort in-place, thereby saving memory. This, however, makes the algorithm unstable, meaning that equal elements may not maintain their original order.

7. **Parallelization**: QuickSort can be parallelized for even faster sorting on multi-core machines.

8. **Adaptivity**: While QuickSort is not adaptive (does not work better with partially sorted arrays), its worst-case performance can be mitigated through proper pivot selection or hybrid approaches.

By understanding the nuances of each step and how they interact, you can achieve a strong grasp of QuickSort's inner workings.

### 1. Hoare vs. Lomuto Partitioning Schemes

Both the Hoare and Lomuto schemes are methods for partitioning the array during the QuickSort or QuickSelect process. Let's delve into each:

#### Hoare Partitioning

1. **Initial Positioning**: Start with two indices, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`).
2. **Searching**: Move `left` towards the right and `right` towards the left. The `left` index skips over elements smaller than the pivot, and the `right` index skips over elements larger than the pivot.
3. **Swapping**: When `left` and `right` indices find elements that should be on the opposite sides of the pivot, swap them.
4. **Termination**: Stop when `left >= right`, and return `right` as the final position of the pivot.

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
def hoare_partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[low]
    left = low + 1
    right = high
    while True:
        while left <= right and arr[left] < pivot:
            left += 1
        while arr[right] > pivot:
            right -= 1
        if left >= right:
            break
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
    arr[low], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[low]
    return right
```

#### Lomuto Partitioning

1. **Pivot**: Select the last element as the pivot.
2. **Initialize**: Take a variable `i` initialized to `low`.
3. **Iterate and Swap**: Iterate through the array. If an element is smaller than the pivot, swap it with the element at index `i` and increment `i`.
4. **Final Swap**: Swap the pivot element with the element at index `i`.

Here's a Python example:

```python
def lomuto_partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            i += 1
    arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]
    return i
```

#### Comparison

- **Efficiency**: Hoare’s scheme does three times fewer swaps on average and is generally faster.
- **Stability**: Neither of them is stable.
- **Implementation**: Lomuto is generally considered easier to implement.

### 2. Tail Recursion

#### What is Tail Recursion?

In a tail-recursive function, the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This means that the function doesn't have to perform any more operations or hold onto any variables after the recursive call returns.

#### Benefits

1. **Optimization**: The compiler or interpreter can optimize tail recursion to reduce the amount of stack space required.
2. **Predictable Stack Depth**: Because no additional work is done after the recursive call, it allows for a more predictable and constant stack depth.

#### Why Save Stack Space?

Each function call, including recursive ones, consumes stack space to save variables, return addresses, and perform other tasks. Saving stack space is important to prevent stack overflow errors and make the program more efficient.

#### Example with Tail Recursion

Consider the following QuickSort function implemented using tail recursion.

```python
def quicksort_tail_recursive(arr, low, high):
    while low < high:
        pivot = lomuto_partition(arr, low, high)
        
        # Tail-recursive case for the smaller partition
        if pivot - low < high - pivot:
            quicksort_tail_recursive(arr, low, pivot - 1)
            low = pivot + 1
        else:
            quicksort_tail_recursive(arr, pivot + 1, high)
            high = pivot - 1
```

In this implementation, the tail-recursive quicksort function sorts the smaller partition first. Then, it adjusts the boundaries (`low` and `high`) to sort the larger partition. This ensures that the function uses constant stack space for each tail-recursive call, thereby optimizing the algorithm.
